# Clipboard
This is a clipboard module we created for the Bodhi Linux's e17 fork, Moksha. Despite being developed for Moksha, it should work on any e17 DesktopÂ _meeting the requirements below_.

Clipboard currently is a simple, basic features clipboard manager. It maintains a history of text copied to the clipboard from which you can choose with a bare minimum of configuration options. Our main ambition, aside from learning EFL and enlightenment module programming, was to make it light on system resources with no additional dependencies, integrate in a natural way with the e17/Moksha desktops and be a usable alternative to other clipboard managers (Parcellite, CopyQ, glipper etc.).
