Hi all, 

My name is Landy DeField.

I recently joined the documentation team and have been working directly with @ylee to get settled in. I'll also be assisting with managing the website, along with content creation for the Patreon account.

A Little About Me 

I'm the retired owner of our multi generational family marketing agency. 

I have been a full-time desktop Linux user since 1998. In 2001 my wife(theobroma) and I created the Revelinux desktop distro based on Koppix. We later joined the KDE-Artists development team in order to unify and standardize the artwork upstream. It was during this time we created the original Kollaboration forum in order to maximize community contributions and speed up the development cycle. It was wildly successful, however in 2003-04 there were a ton of shakeups in KDE with the introduction of plasma. In addition, we had come to the conclusion after converting hundreds of people over to Revelinux, and maintaining their systems, most people were not willing to pay for our time or take responsibility for their own computers. It just so happened, Ubuntu was first released within weeks of us making the decision to go in a new direction. We converted almost every one of our Revelinux clients over to Ubuntu and focused all of our attention towards our internet marketing startup. 

In 2010, I built our first web server and added a Debian Gnu/Linux Sysadmin to my 'hat collection'.

I'm a huge Enlightenment fan, having first used e16 years ago. I have daydreamed for years about creating an enlightenment based distro, and just recently rediscovered Bodhi (I used Bodhi for a bit in the past).

I'm looking forward to contributing documentation, and content to Bodhi Linux, in order to help promote this community driven, fast as lightening distro. 

I'm @landnull on the Bodhi Discord Server
